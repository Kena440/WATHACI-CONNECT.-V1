# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Recent Updates

- ✅ Merged changes from main branch with conflict resolution
- ✅ Added typecheck script for TypeScript validation  
- ✅ Preserved modular component architecture with extracted variants

## Testing

Lighthouse and automated accessibility checks are available via npm scripts.

```bash
# Run accessibility tests powered by jest-axe
npm run test:accessibility

# Generate a Lighthouse report (requires a running dev server)
npm run test:lighthouse
```

Make sure project dependencies are installed before executing the test commands.
