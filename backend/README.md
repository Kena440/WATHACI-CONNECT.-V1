# Backend

This backend uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

Security middleware:

- [helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) sets common HTTP headers to help protect the app.
- [express-rate-limit](https://github.com/nfriedly/express-rate-limit) applies basic request rate limiting.

Run the backend tests with:

```
npm --prefix backend test
```
